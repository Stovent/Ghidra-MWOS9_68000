## Special thanks

- Phlosioneer (https://github.com/Phlosioneer) for his original source code that helped me getting started fast.

## TODO

- Add all possible OS-9 and CD-I data structures
    - Missing kernel data structures and CD-I ones.
- Add all system calls
    - Handle the OS-9 return value.
    - Add all their parameters.
- Add support for module groups (ideally load all of them at the same time).
- Add program exec input registers.
- Add calling conventions to standard functions
- Set parameters of standard routines.
